### Problem Solved

One of my clients needed a way of automations an application for android. So I created a script using python to automate functions by sending inputs from pc to the connected devices through USB.

### Technologies Used

I used python as my scripting language and ADB with Appium in order to interact with the screen elements.

### Challenges Faced

It was a very new type of project for me at the time and it was definitely challenging because I had to learn what I could use in order to interact with on screen elements across multiple devices from a PC. 

### Lessons Learned

I learned a ton about python and using tools such as jupyter notebook as well as gaining a much deeper understanding of Android and how it works.
